You could find the corresponding AQUASIM project file in ``Chapter 2/SI_Chapter_2_Aquasim_BNR-Guilds-Growth-Models_Batch-Chemostat.aqu``.


## Batch

**Simpo** project for this example could be found in <a href="https://dash.simpowater.org/dashboard/projects/public/name/BWTEE%202.3.4%20Batch/id/95/did/74">BWTEE 2.3.4 Batch</a>.



## Create
:::info Note
If you just input the component, parameter, matrix and dataset details as described in the book, you cannot get the result as the book's figures.
Because the AQUASIM project details are not the same as in the book.
:::
Create the BioModel, DataSet and Project exactly as in AQUASIM project file (not the book!).

## Result
:::info Note
The measured data are the AQUASIM calculation results.

We selected ``Backward`` solver to make the simulation.
The ``Weighted NSE`` is ``1.0``, which means the simulation result generated from ``AQUASIM`` is almost the same as in **Simpo**.
