# Intro

<!-- Let's discover **Docusaurus in less than 5 minutes**. -->
Welcome to **SIMPO** tutorials.

## Introduction

**SIMPO** is a SaaS platform for calculating the matrix like biochemical models (such as activated sludge models 1, 2 and 3). The aim of this project is to help people to build and calculate their own wasterwater treatment process easily. The input of the whole process are only 3 excel xlsx files. By this way, you can check and make your own biological model conveniently.

The core ideas of **SIMPO** platform are:

- **Easy to Use**: provides a convenient solution to simulate and evaluate the modles and datas, at most 3 xlsx files and you are good to go.
- **Powerful and Flexible**: one can arbitrary combine the modles and datas only if the model’s components are the same as the data’s targets.
- **Open-Minded**: modles and datas can be reused and shared to the community.
- **Trackable**: all the algorithms are open source, the modle’s structure and the data authenticity can be tracked effectively.
