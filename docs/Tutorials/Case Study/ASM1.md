# ASM1

<!-- **SIMPO** -->

- Clone **BioModel** <a href="http://111.230.245.215/dashboard/biomodels/public/name/ASM1/id/35/did/34">ASM1</a> from the Public to Personal repository.
- Create a new **Project** with ASM1 **BioModel** and an empty **DataSet**, then you would get:
  - A CSRT tank with the Targets exact the same as the Components of ASM1.
  - All Targets initial values are set to be 200.
  - Calcluation time sets to be 2 days and in 0.1 day interval.
- Then you can just start Simulation and Evaluation.
