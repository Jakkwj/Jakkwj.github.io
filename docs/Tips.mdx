# Tips

- To make a **exponentiation** in BioModel.Matrix/DataSet.Connetions.Flow, use ****** (instead of **^**).
- Set the web browser **Backspace** key **NOT** to go back to previous page, so you would be interrupted while you are making the formular in BioModel.Matrix/DataSet.Connetions.Flow.
- Don't do the calculation under a browser's incognito mode, it seems it won't start the calculation correctly.
