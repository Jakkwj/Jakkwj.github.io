## 2023-12-10

Version **0.0.3.2** is released.

The major achievement of this version is the Uncertianty and Estimation tasks are now live (although not all the functions are available).

### Key Features

- Differential equation solving method is greatly optimized, and the forward interpolation algorithm is about 100 times faster.
- Support adjusting the calculation accuracy (5-20% change rate due to step size) to further improve the calculation speed.
- The calculation files are partially transferred to local computer to do the compilation to improve the network response speed.
- Server network (hardware) speed upgraded form 1 mb to 2 mb.
- BioModel/DataSet/Project can be directly exported to standard excel files with formatting.
- When calculating, you can see the result pictures dynamically in local computer (Windows 10 needs to change the default image browser to refresh the pictures dynamically).
- Calculation results can be opened directly in the local computer's folder.

### Details

- Added
  - Now the input.dat will be generated in client computer, while the calcaltion files still need to download from server.
  - After the calculation, the result will be stored in client computer and upload the result json to server.
- Changed
  - Ubunut will only support 20 (not 16/18 any more).
