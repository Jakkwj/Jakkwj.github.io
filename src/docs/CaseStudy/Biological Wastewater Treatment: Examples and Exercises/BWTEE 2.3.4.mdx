You could find the corresponding AQUASIM project file in ``Chapter 2/SI_Chapter_2_Aquasim_BNR-Guilds-Growth-Models_Batch-Chemostat.aqu``.

:::warning Caution
If you just input the BioModel and DataSet details as described in the book, you cannot get the result as the book's figures.
Because the AQUASIM project details are not the same as in the book.

## Batch

**SIMPO** project for this example could be found in <a href="https://dash.simpowater.org/dashboard/projects/public/name/BWTEE%202.3.4%20Batch/id/407/did/406">BWTEE 2.3.4 Batch</a>.

### Create
Create the BioModel, DataSet and Project exactly as in AQUASIM project file (not the book).

### Result
:::tip Tip
The measured data are the AQUASIM calculation results.

The ``Weighted NSE`` is ``1.0``, which means the simulation result generated from **SIMPO** is almost the same as in ``AQUASIM``.


## Chemostat
**SIMPO** project for this example could be found in <a href="https://dash.simpowater.org/dashboard/projects/public/name/BWTEE%202.3.4%20Chemostat/id/413/did/409">BWTEE 2.3.4 Chemostat</a>.

### Create
Create the BioModel, DataSet and Project exactly as in AQUASIM project file (not the book).


### Result
:::tip Tip
The measured data are also come from the AQUASIM calculation, but with less result sampling rate. To increse the calculation speed, the sampling rate decrease from 1h/point to 5h/point.

The ``Weighted NSE`` is ``0.99999``, the slight difference comes from ``S_O2`` (``NSE`` is 0.99992) and ``X_DHO`` (``NSE`` is ``0.99999``), and all of the ``NSE`` of the others are ``1``.

#### ``S_O2``
- **SIMPO** will dynamically adjust the time interval to improve calculation speed and ensure accuracy in the mean time, if the simulation become more and more stable, the time interval will become larger.
- The volumetric mass transfer coefficient (``k_L_a``) of ``S_O2`` in this example is ``100 mmolO2/h`` and the rate expression is ``k_L_a*(S_O2_sat-S_O2)``, which makes the rate of Aeration process won't decrease and could be very large if the time interval become large, and this is the reason that cause the difference.
- To get stable result of ``S_O2``, we should lower the Amplified Rate (to ``1.0001``) and Step Tolerance (to ``0.0001``).
- The stable value (last few points) of AQUASIM is ``0.28`` and **SIMPO** is around ``0.2799``.

  </div>


#### ``X_DHO``
- The difference in ``X_DHO`` could just be the accuracy error of decimal separator, the stable value (last few points) of AQUASIM is ``1.232`` and **SIMPO** is ``1.23248``.
