A mathematical model describing the interaction between nitrifiers, heterotrophs and predators in wastewater treatment has been developed. The inclusion of a predation mechanism is a new addition to the existing activated sludge models. The developed model considered multi-substrate consumption and multi-species growth, maintenance and decay in a culture where nitrifiers, heterotrophs and predators (protozoa and metazoa) are coexisting. Two laboratory-scale sequenced batch reactors (SBRs) operated at different sludge retention time (SRT) of 30 and 100 days for a period of 4 years were used to calibrate and validate the model. Moreover, to assess the predator activity, a simple procedure was developed, based on measuring the respiration rate with and without the presence of the predators. The model successfully described the performance of two SBRs systems. The fraction of active biomass (ammonia oxidisers, nitrite oxidisers and heterotrophs) predicted by the proposed model was only 33% and 14% at SRT of 30 and 100 days, respectively. The high fraction of inert biomass predicted by the model was in accordance with the microscopic investigations of biomass viability in both reactors. The presented model was used to investigate the effect of increasing sludge age and the role of predators on the biomass composition of the tested SBR system.

**Q: What problem does this paper attempt to solve?**

**Kimi:**
The paper "Modelling nitriﬁcation, heterotrophic growth and predation in activated sludge" primarily focuses on the interactions between nitrification, heterotrophic growth, and predation within activated sludge systems, and attempts to describe these interactions through the development of a mathematical model. Specifically, the paper aims to address the following issues:

1. **Interaction between nitrification and heterotrophic microorganisms**: Nitrifying bacteria and heterotrophic microorganisms play crucial roles in the treatment of nitrogen and organic matter in wastewater. The paper describes the interactions between these microbial communities and how they collectively affect the efficiency of the system through a model.

2. **Introduction of predation mechanisms**: Traditional activated sludge models often do not consider the impact of predators. This paper attempts to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how predation behavior affects the activity and biomass composition of nitrifying and heterotrophic bacteria by introducing predation mechanisms into the model.

3. **Multi-substrate consumption and multi-species growth, maintenance, and decay**: The model in the paper considers the consumption of multiple substrates and the growth, maintenance, and decay of multiple microbial populations. This multi-substrate and multi-species approach helps to more accurately simulate actual activated sludge systems.

4. **The role of sludge age (SRT) on biomass composition**: The paper explores how different sludge ages (i.e., the residence time of sludge in the system) affect the composition of active biomass (including nitrifying bacteria, heterotrophic bacteria, and predators) and the accumulation of inert biomass through the model.

5. **Impact of predators on nitrification and heterotrophic activity**: The paper also investigates the influence of predators on the presence and activity of nitrifying and heterotrophic bacteria, which is crucial for understanding the role of predators in activated sludge systems.

6. **Application of laboratory-scale sequencing batch reactors (SBRs)**: To calibrate and validate the model, the researchers used two laboratory-scale sequencing batch reactors operating under different sludge age conditions. The model was able to successfully describe the performance of the SBR systems and predict the proportion of active biomass.

In summary, this paper attempts to enhance our understanding of microbial interactions within activated sludge systems, especially considering the role of predators, and how to optimize sludge age and improve the overall treatment efficiency of the system. This has significant practical implications for the design and optimization of wastewater treatment processes.

**Q: What are the relevant studies?**

**Kimi:**
The study of interactions between nitrification, heterotrophic growth, and predation in activated sludge is a complex field with numerous related research efforts. Here are some areas and specific studies that are relevant to the topic:

1. **Activated Sludge Modeling**:
   - ASM models (Henze et al., 2000) are a series of mathematical models that describe the biological processes in activated sludge systems. These models have been continuously developed and improved upon by various researchers to better represent the complex interactions within the system.

**Q: How the paper solves this problem?**

**Kimi:**
This paper addresses the issue of interactions between nitrification, heterotrophic growth, and predation in activated sludge systems through the following key steps:

1. **Development of a Mathematical Model**: The researchers developed a mathematical model to describe the interactions between nitrifying bacteria, heterotrophic microorganisms, and predators (such as protozoa and metazoa). This model considers multi-substrate consumption and the growth, maintenance, and decay of multiple species.

2. **Experimental Validation**: To calibrate and validate this model, the researchers used two laboratory-scale Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBRs) operated under different Sludge Retention Times (SRTs). By running these reactors over a long period and collecting data, the researchers were able to adjust the model parameters to ensure that the model accurately predicts the performance of actual systems.

3. **Analysis of Microbial Community Structure**: Through the model, the researchers analyzed the impact of different SRTs on the composition of active biomass (nitrifying bacteria, heterotrophic bacteria, and predators) and the accumulation of inert biomass. This helps to understand how SRT affects the microbial ecology and treatment efficiency of the system.

4. **Assessment of Predators' Role**: The researchers assessed the role of predators in the system through the model, especially the changes in the fraction of active biomass in the absence of predators. This helps to understand the impact of predators on nitrification and heterotrophic processes and explores the possibility of optimizing system performance by controlling predators.

5. **Model Application and Optimization**: The researchers used the model to simulate and predict the performance of the system under different operational conditions, including the performance of reactors at different SRTs. This provides a theoretical basis for designing and optimizing actual wastewater treatment systems.

Through these methods, the paper not only provides a theoretical framework for understanding the complex microbial interactions in activated sludge systems but also offers a tool that can help environmental engineers and researchers optimize wastewater treatment processes to improve system efficiency and stability.

**Q: What experiments were done for the paper?**

**Kimi:**
The paper "Modelling nitriﬁcation, heterotrophic growth and predation in activated sludge" conducted the following experiments to support the development and validation of the mathematical model:

1. **Laboratory-Scale Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBRs)**: The researchers operated two SBRs at different Sludge Retention Times (SRTs) of 30 and 100 days for a period of 4 years. These reactors were used to simulate real-world conditions and to collect data for model calibration and validation.

2. **Continuous Operation and Monitoring**: The SBRs were automatically operated in cycles that included a fill period, reaction period, settling time, and effluent discharge. The researchers continuously monitored parameters such as dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, and temperature, and controlled the pH using automated systems.

3. **Substrate Addition and Biomass Analysis**: A synthetic medium containing ammonia and nutrients was used to feed the SBRs. The mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) were measured, along with ammonia (NH4+), nitrite (NO2-), and nitrate (NO3-) concentrations.

4. **Respiration Activity Assay**: The oxygen uptake rate (OUR) was measured using a biological oxygen monitor (BOM) to estimate the activity and viability of the biomass. This involved injecting different substrates (NO2, NH4, COD) into the reaction chamber and monitoring the decrease in oxygen concentration.

5. **Determination of Predators' Activity**: The activity of predators was determined by measuring the respiration under starvation conditions with and without the presence of predators. A salt shock (NaCl) was used to eliminate predators and measure the impact on the remaining biomass.

6. **Analytical Procedures**: Various analytical methods were employed to measure the concentrations of nitrogen species and organic matter. This included spectrophotometry, ion chromatography, and filtration techniques for MLSS and MLVSS determination.

7. **Staining Techniques (Live-Dead Stain)**: Molecular Probes' LIVE/DEAD BacLightTM Bacterial Viability Kits were used to discriminate between viable cells and dead cells in the microbial community.

8. **Model Calibration and Validation**: The collected data from the SBRs were used to calibrate the model parameters, such as the predation rate, decay rate of predators, and the fraction of inert COD generated in biomass lysis. The calibrated model was then validated against the observed performance of the SBRs.

These experiments provided a comprehensive dataset that allowed the researchers to develop a detailed understanding of the interactions between different microbial groups in the activated sludge system and to validate the mathematical model's predictions against real-world observations.
