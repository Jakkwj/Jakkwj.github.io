## 2024-05-23

Version **0.0.4.1** is released.

The major achievement of this version is improved the precision of calculation.

- Changed

  - Empty lines are not allowed in Solution.Convention.

- Improved

  - The range of Forward Euler step tolerance change to 0.01%~20%.
  - Forward/Improved Euler won't cutted to 0 when a Component is <= 1e-30, now it will step into 0 to keep mass balance.
  - If a Rate expression doesn't contain a Component, it can be negative.
  - If a Rate expression does contain a Component, and it become negative, the calculation will be stopped.
  - If a Rate expression's denominator is 0, the calculation will be stopped.

The major achievement of this version is adding Inflow plotting.

- Added

  - Add Inflow target plotting.

- Fixed
  - Fixed some known bugs.

## 2024-05-04

Version **0.0.3.7** is released.

The major achievement of this version is the raw input data of Measured/Inflow/Flow can be compressed by setting the resolution rate (retention rate of raw data). If you set the resolution to 10%, it will only calculation the raw 10% data (even interval), so you can speed up a lot if you don't need so much high precision.

- Added

  - Add time index resolution rate to compress raw Measured/Inflow/Flow data
  - Add auto_plot_correlation to skip plot_OAT_Corr(), since this could take a very long time if data is large.

- Fixed
  - Fixed some known bugs.

## 2024-04-25

Version **0.0.3.6** is released.

This version is a minor upgrade and stabilization. Upgrade sludge/slduge_pro to the latest version.

- Changed
  - Client folder seperate the package and source. And the package will be download after install the client main programe.
