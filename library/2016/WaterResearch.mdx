Autotrophic denitrification (AD) plays a critical role in nitrate removal from organic carbon-deficient wastewaters with a high level of nitrogen oxides. However, the AD process is not included in the current denitrification models, which limits the application of AD technology for wastewater treatment. In this work, a kinetic model for AD process involved 4 processes and 5 components with 9 parameters is established to describe the sulphide biooxidation and nitrite removal process. In this model, 4 oxidation–reduction reactions using sulphide as electronic donor in the AD process are taken into account. The model parameters are optimized by fitting data from the experiments with different combinations of sulphide, sulphur, sulphate, nitrate and nitrite at various concentrations. Model calibration and validation results demonstrate that the developed model is able to reasonably describe the removal rates of nitrate, nitrite, sulphide and sulphur in the AD process. The model simulation results also show that the sulphur term (η(S)) in the kinetic equations of nitrate, nitrite, sulphur and sulphate remains constant, rather than being controlled by its own concentration. Furthermore, with this model the products of sulphide biooxidation in the AD process, sulphur and sulphate, and their concentrations can be accurately predicted. Therefore, this model provides a strategy to control the sulphate concentration below the discharge limits or recover sulphur as the main end product from sulphide biooxidation.

**Q: What problem does this paper attempt to solve?**

**Kimi:**
This paper primarily aims to address how to improve the understanding and application of the autotrophic denitrification (AD) process through mathematical modeling. Autotrophic denitrification is an important wastewater treatment technology that can convert nitrates in wastewater into nitrogen gas by using inorganic substances such as sulfide as electron donors, thereby removing nitrogen oxides, especially in conditions lacking organic carbon.

The main objectives of the paper include:

1. **Establishing a Kinetic Model**: Developing a kinetic model that includes multiple redox reactions and components to describe the biooxidation of sulfide and the removal process of nitrites.

2. **Parameter Optimization**: Optimizing the parameters within the model using experimental data to enhance the model's predictive accuracy.

3. **Model Validation**: Validating the model's predictive capabilities and accuracy by comparing it with experimental data from other researchers.

4. **Controlling Sulfate Concentration**: Using the model to control the generation of sulfate during the AD process, ensuring its concentration is below discharge standards, or recovering sulfur from the biooxidation of sulfide.

5. **Predicting Oxidation Products of Sulfide**: Accurately predicting the concentrations of sulfide oxidation products (such as sulfur and sulfate) in the AD process to provide a basis for process control.

Through this research, the paper aims to provide environmental engineers with a powerful tool to more effectively design, operate, and optimize the autotrophic denitrification process, reduce the emission of nitrogen oxides during wastewater treatment, and achieve the recovery and reuse of resources. This has significant practical implications for environmental protection and sustainable development.

**Q: How the paper solves this problem?**

**Kimi:**
The paper addresses the mathematical modeling issue of the autotrophic denitrification (AD) process through the following methods:

1. **Establishing a Kinetic Model**: The researchers developed a kinetic model that includes 4 processes and 5 components, covering the biooxidation of sulfide and the removal of nitrates and nitrites in the AD process. The model incorporates redox reactions using sulfide as an electron donor.

2. **Parameter Optimization**: Through experimental data, the researchers optimized the 9 parameters within the model. These parameters include the maximum specific growth rate, electron distribution coefficients, half-saturation constants, etc., and their optimal values were determined by fitting the experimental data.

3. **Model Calibration and Validation**: The researchers calibrated and validated the model using different experimental datasets, which included various concentrations of sulfide, sulfur, sulfate, nitrates, and nitrites. The model's predictions matched the experimental data, proving the model's effectiveness.

4. **Analysis of the Sulfur Term (η(S))**: The researchers discussed the representation of the sulfur term (η(S)) in the kinetic equations. By comparing the model's predictive results, they determined that the sulfur term is better expressed as a constant rather than the traditional Monod type during the AD process.

**Q: What experiments were done for the paper?**

**Kimi:**
Based on the content provided from the paper, the authors conducted the following experiments to support their research and model development:

1. **Experimental Setup**: A bench-scale Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) with a working volume of 10 liters was constructed to serve as the AD reactor. This reactor was operated in a batch mode with a hydraulic retention time of 18 hours, settling time of 2.0 hours, drainage time of 0.20 hours, influent time of 0.40 hours, and idle time of 3.0 hours.

2. **Synthetic Wastewater Composition**: The components of synthetic wastewater included Na2S·9H2O, KNO3, NH4Cl, KH2PO4, NaHCO3, CaCl2, MgCl2·6H2O, and trace elements. HCl was used to adjust the wastewater pH to approximately 7.2. Background concentrations of S2-, SO42-, NO3-, and NO2- in the water were also recorded.

3. **Inoculated Sludge**: Inoculated sludge was collected from the Shiweitou Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant in Xiamen, China, with a suspended solid (SS) concentration of 3214 ± 212 mg L-1.

4. **Reactor Operation Conditions**: The reactor temperature was set at 30 ± 0.5°C, as this temperature range is optimal for the growth of autotrophic denitrifying bacteria. An electric hand blender at 200 rpm was used to achieve uniform mixing. After the reactor reached a steady state, the SS concentration varied slightly and remained at 1480 ± 157 mg L-1.

5. **Solids Retention Time**: Considering the slow growth of autotrophic denitrifying bacteria (ADB), the solids retention time was set at a relatively long period of 30 days by discharging excess sludge to enrich autotrophic sludge.

6. **Experimental Operations**: After reaching a steady state, experiments on the AD reactor were conducted at two S/N (sulfide/nitrogen) molar ratios. Sufficient time was given to ensure the sludge adapted to the changes in substrate before moving on to the next test.

7. **Data Collection**: Data on the concentrations of S2-, SO42-, NO3-, and NO2- were collected, as well as performance changes of the reactor over the course of one year.

These experiments aimed to simulate and study the AD process, providing experimental data for the establishment and validation of the mathematical model. Through these experiments, the researchers were able to optimize the model parameters and verify the model's accuracy in predicting the chemical transformations and removal efficiencies in the AD process.
