An additional module for the prediction of enhanced biological phosphorus removal is presented on the basis of a calibrated version of ASM3. The module uses modified processes from ASM2d but neglects the fermentation of readily degradable substrate. Biomass decay is modeled in the form of endogenous respiration as in ASM3. The glycogen pool and biologically induced P-precipitation is not taken into account. The module was systematically calibrated with experimental data from various batch experiments, a full-scale WWTP and a pilot plant treating Swiss municipal wastewater. A standard parameter set allowed all data to be simulated.

**Q: What problem does this paper attempt to solve?**

**Kimi:**
This paper introduces an additional module—the EAWAG Bio-P module—to enhance the predictive capabilities of ASM3 (Activated Sludge Model No. 3), particularly in the area of Enhanced Biological Phosphorus Removal (EBPR). ASM3 is a fundamental activated sludge model primarily used for predicting oxygen consumption, sludge production, nitrification, and denitrification in municipal wastewater treatment systems, but it does not include a biological phosphorus removal process. The development of the EAWAG Bio-P module aims to fill this gap by integrating the biological phosphorus removal process into the ASM3 model for modeling and prediction.

Specifically, the paper attempts to address the following issues:

1. **Modeling of Biological Phosphorus Removal Process**: By introducing the EAWAG Bio-P module, the biological phosphorus removal process is integrated into the ASM3 model to enable a more comprehensive simulation and prediction of nitrogen and phosphorus removal in wastewater treatment processes.

2. **Parameter Calibration and Validation**: The model is systematically calibrated and validated against experimental data from various batch experiments, full-scale wastewater treatment plants, and pilot plants treating Swiss municipal wastewater, ensuring the accuracy and applicability of the model parameters.

3. **Simplification of Model Complexity**: The model is simplified as much as possible while maintaining accuracy, such as neglecting the fermentation process of readily degradable substrates and additional glycogen pools, to reduce the complexity and computational demands of the model.

4. **Adaptation to Different Operating Conditions**: The model is calibrated to adapt to different operating conditions and wastewater characteristics, such as the "Monday effect" following low COD loads, and the treatment effects under different Sludge Retention Times (SRTs).

5. **Improving Model Predictive Ability**: Through calibration and validation, the model is ensured to accurately predict different dynamic effects, such as normal phosphorus release and uptake in the short term, washout and growth of PAO (Polyphosphate-accumulating organisms) in the long term, and peaks of phosphate in the effluent after short periods of low COD loads.

In summary, the goal of this paper is to develop and validate a model that can accurately simulate and predict the biological phosphorus removal process, in order to better understand and optimize the efficiency of phosphorus removal in municipal wastewater treatment systems.

**Q: How the paper solves this problem?**

**Kimi:**
The paper addresses the modeling issue of Enhanced Biological Phosphorus Removal (EBPR) through the following steps:

1. **Model Development**: An additional module, the EAWAG Bio-P module, was developed to extend the ASM3 model to include the biological phosphorus removal process. This module is based on a calibrated version of ASM3 and incorporates modified processes from ASM2d, but excludes the fermentation of readily degradable substrates.

2. **Parameter Definition**: Four additional state variables were defined in addition to the 13 components already defined in ASM3 to model the biological phosphorus removal process. These variables include inorganic soluble phosphorus (SPO4), phosphorus-accumulating organisms (XPAO), cell-internal storage products (XPHA), and polyphosphate (XPP).

3. **Process Definition**: Eleven additional processes related to biological phosphorus removal were described in detail, including the uptake, storage, and release of phosphorus, as well as the aerobic and anoxic growth conditions of phosphorus-accumulating organisms (PAO).

4. **Systematic Calibration**: The EAWAG Bio-P module was systematically calibrated using experimental data from various batch experiments, full-scale wastewater treatment plants, and pilot plants treating Swiss municipal wastewater. An iterative approach was used to calibrate highly correlated parameters in groups and validate them with different batch experiments.

5. **Dynamic Effect Simulation**: The model is capable of simulating different dynamic effects, such as normal phosphorus release and uptake, washout and growth of PAO, and peaks of phosphate in the effluent after periods of low COD loads (e.g., weekends, rainy days, holidays).

6. **Model Validation**: The accuracy of the model was verified through comparisons with experimental data. This includes validation of long-term simulations and short-term dynamic variations (such as diurnal variations).

7. **Simplification and Adaptability**: The model design considered simplification of complexity, for example, by neglecting an additional glycogen pool, and adapting the module to typical conditions of Swiss municipal wastewater.

Through these steps, the paper successfully integrates the biological phosphorus removal process into the ASM3 model and enhances the model's capability to predict the efficiency of biological phosphorus removal through calibration and validation with experimental data. This provides wastewater treatment engineers with a powerful tool to optimize design and operation for improved phosphorus removal efficiency.

<TabItem value="experiment" label="Experiment" >

**Q: What experiments were done for the paper?**

**Kimi:**
The paper "The EAWAG BIO-P module for activated sludge model no. 3" conducted and utilized a variety of experiments to develop, calibrate, and validate the Bio-P module. Here are the key experiments mentioned in the paper:

1. **Batch Experiments**: A series of batch experiments were carried out to study the decay rates of polyphosphate and the endogenous respiration of PAO (Phosphorus-Accumulating Organisms) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. These experiments helped to estimate the decrease of PAO and were used to calibrate kinetic parameters such as the rate constant for storage of XPHA (qPHA), and the maximum growth rate of XPAO (mPAO).

2. **P-release and P-uptake Experiments**: These experiments were performed to determine the maximum P-release as well as the maximum aerobic and anoxic P-uptake. They were conducted during all important phases of the project and were used to fine-tune the stoichiometric parameters, such as the yield of biomass per XPHA (YPAOO2 and YPAO,NO), and the requirement of XPHA per XPP storage (YPHA).

3. **Wash-out and Grow-in Experiments**: A series of batch experiments were conducted to examine the maximum decay (bPP, bPAO) and growth rate (mPAO) of PAO, as well as the P-release/P-uptake rates (qPHA, qPP). These experiments were carried out under different flow schemes and influent conditions over a period of 140 days.

4. **Diurnal Variation Experiments**: The paper mentions diurnal variation experiments conducted at the Tu¨ﬀenwies pilot plant, which was operated in AAO mode. The initial conditions of the sludge were calculated from previous time periods to simulate the behavior of denitrification and Bio-P over a single diurnal cycle.

5. **Full-scale Experiments**: In addition to the batch and pilot plant experiments, the paper also refers to experiments conducted at a full-scale wastewater treatment plant (Neugut WWTP). The plant was modeled as a cascade of CSTRs, and the secondary clarifier was modeled with an inlet zone, a sludge blanket, and a clear water zone. The model was calibrated and validated against data from this plant, particularly focusing on the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus.

These experiments were crucial for the development of the Bio-P module as they provided the empirical data necessary to refine the model's parameters and validate its predictive capabilities for biological phosphorus removal in different operational conditions and scenarios.
